# HFR_DP1

This package is the Public Workshop version of the HFR_DP software for reprocessing SeaSonde-type HF radar data sets.

This package contains the master programs to process CODAR-type HF Radar
system data from the estimated spectra (the *.css or *.cs4) files to
radial velocities averaged over an azimuthal window for a particular 
COS radar site. 

See HFR_DP_SETUP_README.m for setup and package details.
